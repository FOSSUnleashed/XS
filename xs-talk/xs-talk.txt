The eXtensible Shell (xs)

rc (Plan9) => es => xs

Both ancestors are still present, but
not actively maintained:

@web http://tobold.org/article/rc

@web https://wryun.github.io/es-shell/

Xs development inactive since 2015.
Still packaged in Fedora (F20).

@dnf -C info xs|less

Released version (xs 1.0) has serious
flaws in implementation and man page.

Language has Lisp-ish semantics with
infix syntax.

Example: This presentation is run by:

@less plz

Lists, function parameters, closures,
exceptions, lexical bindings, lambdas

However: closure returned from function
does not work (no upward funargs). :(

But you can still instantiate functions
(including closed-over functions) from
a function:

@less obj-example.xs

You can also do something akin to Lisp
macros:

@less -f <{xs -v macro-example.xs >[2=1]}

Above the interpreter and platform
API, much of xs is written in xs.

@less ../initial.xs

Two-stage compile-/link-time bootstrap.

@touch ../dump.cxx ../initial.xs
@make -C ..

Many primitives can be replaced by
user-defined functions written in xs.

REPL is written in xs and can be
replaced by user.

@less +/Read-eval-print\ loops ../initial.xs

Command-line editing and history is
provided by GNU readline.

Improved over v1.0:
  - added modulus (%) operator
  - added builtin printf
  - added Unicode character escapes
  - corrected pushd/popd behavior
  - added dirs command
  - added rudimentary jobs command
  - added history command
  - tab completion of function names
  - tab completion of variable names
  - added SIGWINCH handler
  - control sequences in $prompt w/o
    $&promptignore and $&nopromptignore
  - many man page corrections
  - many bug fixes
  - expanded test suite

Deficits:
  - no job control (^Z, fg, bg, disown)
  - debugger bit-rot
  - weak/incomplete tests
  - size (3+ MB?!) [blame Boost?]
  - ...

Xs - The eXtensible Shell
=========================

Xs is a cleanly-designed shell with functional programming. It is
based on the source-code for the es project, which was in the public
domain. The changes in xs can also be considered to be in the public
domain.

Xs is not source-level compatible with es. See xs(1) for more details.

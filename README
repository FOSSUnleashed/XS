The eXtensible Shell: xs version 1.2
====================================

Xs is the eXtensible Shell descended from Plan9's rc, featuring
a programming language having Lisp-like semantics (lists, function
parameters, closures, exceptions, lexical bindings, lambdas, etc.)
and a conventional syntax.

Xs is based on the source code for the es project, which was derived
from rc. All of these are in the public domain.

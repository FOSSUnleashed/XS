This directory contains a collection of `xs` scripts. Feel free to adopt or
adapt these as needed, but be aware that not all of these scripts will be
useful in all environments. In particular, the `daemons.xs` script is specific
to the author's system and should be reworked or removed as needed. The
herbstluftwm scripts assume the presence of that window manager.

The _* files and directories should all be renamed, replacing the leading `_`
with a `.`, and placed in your home directory.

The other files (those not having a leading `_`) can go into any directory on
$PATH.

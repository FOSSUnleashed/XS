This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

- subscripts don't work in here documents.
- signal handling seems a bit unfinished:
  - INT doesn't always work; not sure why
  - should QUIT cause xs to exit?
- readline completion doesn't see xs function names.
- there are crashes.

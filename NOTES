This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

- variable-name checking may be incorrect (token.cxx).
- subscripts don't work in here documents.
- can't throw from default branch of switch.
- should QUIT cause xs to exit?
- readline completion doesn't see xs function or variable names.

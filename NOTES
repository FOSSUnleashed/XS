This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

  - The hack of ignoring ECHILD in ewait() solves a cosmetic
    problem, but is likely the wrong thing to do. (For example,
    a program that tries to catch ECHILD from a $&wait won't
    work.) I'm fairly certain that the spurious ECHILD reports
    come from a process spawned internal to xs; perhaps as a
    result of calling $&backquote.

  - Is there any reason not to rename %read to read?

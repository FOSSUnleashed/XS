This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

** readline
- tab completion should consider context.

** syntax
- variable-name checking may be incorrect (token.cxx).

** control
- the default branch of switch swallows exceptions
	{|x| switch $x a {echo ok} {throw error test 'not a'}} b

** systemd locale
- systemd does not pass locale environment variables when spawning
  a login shell. This can cause readline to improperly redraw the
  input upon exiting incremental history search when $prompt
  contains multibyte UTF-8 characters.

  While it's possible to "fix" this by editing the getty@.service
  file to comment out the Environment=... line, I think it's safer
  to include the following code in your ~/.xsrc file.
	-- begin ~/.xsrc --
	{~ $LC_ALL ()} && {force_locale = <=true}
	LC_ALL = en_US.utf8
	
	# ... your code goes here ...
	
	if {result $force_locale} {exec xs}
	-- end ~/.xsrc --

This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

- does switch handle optional otherwise clause consistently?
  - in particular: presence vs. absence
- readline completion doesn't see xs function or variable names.
- variable-name checking may be incorrect (token.cxx).
- subscripts don't work in here documents.
- can't throw from a switch.
  - check implementation of throw and escape.

This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

- variable-name checking may be incorrect (token.cxx).
- subscripts don't work in here documents.
- can't throw from default branch of switch.
- signal handling seems a bit unfinished:
  - INT doesn't always work; not sure why
    - After first ^C, xs blocks SIGINT
      ; cat /proc/<pid-of-xs>/status | grep Sig*
  - should QUIT cause xs to exit?
- readline completion doesn't see xs function or variable names.

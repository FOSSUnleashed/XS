This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

** readline
- readline is unaware of %prompt; this affects ^U behavior.
- tab completion should consider context.

** closures
- upward funargs don't work
  - lambda can be returned from a function using `result`,
    but closures don't work when function is applied.
  - for now, this is documented in xs.1.

** control
- `throw retry` can create an uninterruptible loop.
  - for now, this is documented in xs.1.

** syntax
- variable-name checking may be incorrect (token.cxx).

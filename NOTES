This file is a place to collect observations about `xs` behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

- subscripts don't work in here documents.
- signal handling seems a bit unfinished
  - INT doesn't always work; not sure why
  - should QUIT cause xs to exit?
- there are crashes

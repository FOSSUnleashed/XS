This file is a place to collect observations about xs behavior until
they're either documented as intentional or fixed.

** readline
- tab completion should consider context.
- incremental search corrupts display when prompt contains
  a multibyte UTF-8 character.

** syntax
- variable-name checking may be incorrect (token.cxx).
- free caret doesn't always work after subscript
	$x(1)`b		OK
	$a$x(1)`b	not OK

** environment
- list ending with '' does not have print/read equivalence.
  - see var.cxx\importvar() and conv.cxx\Wconv().
	x = 1 2 ''
	echo $#x $x
	xs -c 'echo $#x $x'

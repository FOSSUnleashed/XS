Prerequisites
-------------

Xs requires the boost, ffi, gc (Boehm) and readline libraries.

To build xs you'll need the Clang C++ compiler, the Meson/Ninja build
system, Bison and the developer packages of the libraries noted above.

Xs is known to build with these library versions:
   boost        1.60
   ffi          6.0.2
   gc           1.0.3
   readline     6.3

Installation
------------

To build and install xs, do:

   $ ./build.sh
   $ ./build.sh check
   $ sudo ./build.sh install

Setting xs as your default shell
--------------------------------

Add the xs binary's path to /etc/shells, then change your shell using
usermod or chsh.

Consult readline(1) for options to set in your ~/.inputrc file.  Also,
enable persistent history by assigning a file path to the history variable
in your ~/.xsrc file.

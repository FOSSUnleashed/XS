- Define and run the following function; type any character. Doing so
  breaks the shell's emission of newline upon sigint. Fix this!
    fn bar {
        escape {|fn-out|
           echo here
           escape {|fn-foo|
               %read-char
               out
               echo nope
           }
        }
    }
- Add job control (SIGTSTP, fg, bg, disown).
- Improve the readline experience:
  - Make quoting during completion match what the user would type.
  - Alter completion behavior depending upon command prefix.
  - Repaint prompt and partial input after printing PID of terminated job.
- Fix crashes found by fuzzer.
- Add unit tests.

- Add job control (SIGTSTP, fg, bg).
- Improve the readline experience:
  - Alter completion behavior depending upon command prefix.
  - Repaint prompt and partial input after printing PID of terminated job.
- At full load (e.g. rendering w/Mandelbulber), attempting to spawn a
  background process fails. I suspect a race in which the shell checks for
  the new process before it has started.

- As needed:
  - Fix crashes found by fuzzer.
  - Add unit tests.

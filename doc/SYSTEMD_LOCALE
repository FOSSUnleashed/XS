systemd does not set locale environment variables when spawning
a login shell. This can cause readline to improperly redraw the
input upon exiting incremental history search when $prompt
contains multibyte UTF-8 characters.

The most straightforward solution is to set up the locale in
your ~/.xsrc file:

	-- begin ~/.xsrc --
	LC_ALL = en_US.UTF-8 # or UTF-8 for your region
	LANG = $LC_ALL
	
	# ... your code goes here ...
	-- end ~/.xsrc --

This is a list of more ambitious projects related to `xs`. Feel free to
contact me if you'd like to take on one of these:

* Create a source-level debugger for `xs`. Use hooks where possible;
  otherwise alter the source code in-place (see, for example,
  `samples/_xsrc.d/annotate.xs`). Functionality should include
  breakpoints, traps for errors and signals, stack crawls, variable
  inspection and modification (both lexical and environment variables),
  source listing, etc.

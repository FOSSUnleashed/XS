This is a list of more ambitious projects related to `xs`. Feel free to
contact me if you'd like to take on one of these:

* Create a source-level debugger for `xs`. Use hooks where possible;
  otherwise alter the source code in-place (see, for example,
  `samples/_xsrc.d/annotate.xs`). Functionality should include
  breakpoints, traps for errors and signals, stack crawls, variable
  inspection and modification (both lexical and environment variables),
  source listing, etc.

* Find a way to introspect stack frames. This will be required for a
  source-level debugger, but will also be useful on its own (e.g. for
  isolating errors). At the very least, it'd be nice to have a reliable
  way to identify the current function; `$0` does what it promises, but
  it's not particularly useful.

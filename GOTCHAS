Since you're coming to xs from another shell, there are some things that
you'll need to know.

  * ~/.xsrc is executed only when xs starts as a login shell.
  * ~/.xsin is executed when xs starts as an interactive shell. If xs is
    also a login shell, ~/.xsrc runs first.
  * Apostrophe (') is the only paired quoting character.
  * There are *no* escapes or substitutions of any kind inside '...'.
  * To include a ' inside of '...', double the interior ', e.g. 'Frank''s'.
  * Quote (") has no meaning for quoting. It is accepted as a word constituent.
  * *+,-./:=?@[]_~" is a valid variable name. (These are all the non-special
    punctuation characters.)
  * Substitution inside of a word is done using caret (^) for concatenation,
    e.g.:
    'foo is '^$foo
    and
    'My File.'^*
    xs will also insert a caret when it can do so unambiguously (see Free
    Carets in xs(1)). Thus the above may be written without carets.
  * All values are lists. Variable expansion preserves whitespace.
  * Use the backquote (`) operator to run a command and get its output
    as a list. $ifs determines how to split the command's output text.
    The status of the command is in $bqstatus.
  * To change $ifs for one command, use the double-backquote (``) operator,
    e.g.:
    xy = `` x `{echo 37x42}
    assigns the two-item list 37 42 to the variable xy.
  * Use the <= operator to run a command and get its exit code.
  * The assignment operator (=) must always be surrounded by spaces.
    These are valid words: a=foo grack= =flink =ergh=
  * $#foo returns the number of list items.
  * Use $^foo to flatten $foo into a one-item list with a blank between
    each pair of original list items.
  * The concatenation operator generates the cross-product of lists, e.g.:
    ls foo.^[ch]
    and
    ls bar.^(cxx hxx) .
  * Redirection and piping of stdin/stdout is as you'd expect; there's an
    xs-specfic syntax for all other redirection operations (redirect stderr,
    duplicate a descriptor, close a descriptor).
  * Beware trampolines to builtin commands for other shells, e.g. bash's
    /usr/bin/read.

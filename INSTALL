Prerequisites
-------------

Xs requires the boost, ffi, gc (Boehm) and readline libraries.

You'll need a C++ compiler, the Meson/Ninja build system and Bison, plus
the developer packages of the libraries noted above, in order to build xs.

Basic Installation
------------------

To build and install xs, do:

   $ ./build.sh
   $ ./build.sh check
   $ ./build.sh install

Setting xs as your default shell
--------------------------------

Add the xs binary's path to /etc/shells, then change your shell using
usermod or chsh.

If you built xs with readline, consult readline(1) for options to set
in your ~/.inputrc file.  Also, enable persistent history by assigning
a file path to the history variable in your ~/.xsrc file.

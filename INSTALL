Prerequisites
-------------

Xs requires the boost and gc (Boehm) libraries. The readline or editline
library is strongly recommended, as is the ffi library.

You'll need a C++ compiler, the GNU Autotools and YACC or Bison, plus
the developer packages of the libraries noted above, in order to build xs.

Basic Installation
------------------

Xs uses the GNU configure system for configuration.  This means that on
nearly all platforms, it should just build and work fine. To do this,
just type:

   % autoreconf -i
   % ./configure
   % make

Problems with building
----------------------

  (Is this still true?)

The HP-UX yacc program seems to dislike the use of LOCAL in parse.yxx.
It is not clear to me why this is the case.  FSF's bison works fine.
This has not been `fixed' because it is not clear what is `broken'.
This may also be other dependencies that I do not understand.

Setting xs as your default shell
--------------------------------

Add the xs binary's path to /etc/shells, then change your shell using
usermod or chsh.

If you built xs with readline, consult readline(1) for options to set
in your ~/.inputrc file.  Also, enable persistent history by assigning
a file path to the history variable in your ~/.xsrc file.

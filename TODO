- FIX: Why does build fail w/o libffi?
- printf: add %e, %f and %g conversions.
  - Note that xs stores floating point numbers as
    text with six significant digits (C++ dependency).
    The float formatter doesn't need to be highly
    accurate; xs math is already throwing away tons
    of precision...
- Add job control (SIGTSTP, fg, bg, disown).
- Add tests.
  - relops
  - printf
  - Extend existing suites.
- Add examples.
- Get xsdebug working.

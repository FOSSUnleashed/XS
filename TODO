Add byline to the manpage

Fix readline tab complete weirdness
Remove pushd/popd needless echo

Add function that takes a list of wildcards, returns function that takes a list to match against those wildcards
Fix echo redirect bad file error crash
History functions, how do they work?
Exit on false is buggy, breaks on assignments -- Fix this properly!  Hack is in place
Modify variable meta-data (exportable, type, etc)
Scope/context type variables

Not necessarily a TODO, but the @ command in rc is used to make a subshell.  This is slightly different than fork or %background.
Possible idea?  Make it a co-routine operator?
Better <= operator.  Maybe :
Non-FFI printf
Remove boost.  foreach(iteratordef, list)
XS as an embeddable scripting lang

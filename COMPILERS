This file reports known issues related to the compilation toolchain.

Clang 4.0.1 produces an unusable `xs` executable. Sometimes it'll
fail upon startup. Sometimes it'll start and pass `./build.sh check`
but fail when running the `xs` function `.annotate` from the `samples/`
directory. This suggests either a compiler/library bug or (much more
likely) some questionable `xs` code. Until this is resolved, please
compile `xs` using either GCC or a different version of Clang.

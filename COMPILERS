This file reports known issues related to the compilation toolchain.

Clang 4.0.1 produces an unusable `xs` executable. Sometimes it'll
fail upon startup. Sometimes it'll start and pass `./build.sh check`
but fail when running the `xs` function `annotate` from the `samples/`
directory. And those aren't the only failure modes. This suggests to
me that the `xs` code has tickled either a compiler/library bug or
(much more likely) has wandered into a region of undefined behavior
as regards the C++ language.

Until this is resolved, please compile `xs` using either GCC or a
different version of Clang.
